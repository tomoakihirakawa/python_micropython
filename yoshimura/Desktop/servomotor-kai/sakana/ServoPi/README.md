# Class: PWM #
```
PWM(address, bus)

# Class: Servo #
```
Servo(address, low_limit, high_limit, reset, bus)
```
The Servo class provides functions for controlling the position of servo motors commonly used on radio control models and small robots.  The Servo class initialises with a default frequency of 50Hz and low and high limits of 1ms and 2ms. 

Initialise with the I2C address for the Servo Pi.

```
servo_object = Servo(0x40)
```
**Optional Parameters:**  
low_limit = Pulse length in milliseconds for the lower servo limit. (default = 1.0ms)  
high_limit = Pulse length in milliseconds for the upper servo limit. (default = 2.0ms)  
reset = True: reset the servo controller and turn off all channels .  False: initialise with existing servo positions and frequency. (default = true)  
bus: I2C bus number (integer).  If no value is set the class will try to find the i2c bus automatically using the device name.   

Functions:

Usage
====

**PWM Class**

To use the Servo Pi PWM class in your code you must first import the class:
```
from ServoPi import PWM
```
Next you must initialise the PWM object:
```
pwm = PWM(0x40)
```
Set PWM frequency to 200 Hz and enable the output
```
pwm.set_pwm_freq(200)  
pwm.output_enable()  
```
Set the pulse with of channel 1 to 1024 or 25% duty cycle
```
pwm.set_pwm(1, 0, 1024) 
```

**Servo Class**

To use the Servo Pi Servo class in your code you must first import the class:
```
from ServoPi import Servo
```
Next you must initialise the Servo object:
```
servo = Servo(0x40)
```
Set PWM frequency to 50 Hz
```
servo.set_frequency(50)  
```
Move the servo on channel 1 to position 125 out of 250 steps  
```
servo.move(1, 125, 250)
```
