AB Electronics UK RTC Pi Python Library
=====

Python Library to use with RTC Pi Raspberry Pi real-time clock board from https://www.abelectronics.co.uk

The example python files can be found in /ABElectronics_Python_Libraries/RTCPi/demos  

### Downloading and Installing the library

To download to your Raspberry Pi type in terminal: 

```
git clone https://github.com/abelectronicsuk/ABElectronics_Python_Libraries.git
```

To install the python library navigate into the ABElectronics_Python_Libraries folder and run:  

For Python 2.7:
```
sudo python setup.py install
```
For Python 3.5:
```
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

If you have PIP installed you can install the library directly from github with the following command:

For Python 2.7:
```
sudo python2.7 -m pip install git+https://github.com/abelectronicsuk/ABElectronics_Python_Libraries.git
```

For Python 3.5:
```
sudo python3.4 -m pip install git+https://github.com/abelectronicsuk/ABElectronics_Python_Libraries.git
```

The RTC Pi library is located in the RTCPi directory

The library requires smbus2 or python-smbus to be installed.  

For Python 2.7:
```
sudo pip install smbus2
```
For Python 3.5:
```
sudo pip3 install smbus2
```

Class:
----------

```
RTC(bus)
```
**Parameters:**  
bus (optional): I2C bus number (integer).  If no value is set the class will try to find the i2c bus automatically using the device name.  

Functions:
----------

```
set_date(date) 
```
Set the date and time on the RTC in ISO 8601 format - YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS   
**Parameters:** date   
**Returns:** null

```
read_date() 
```
Returns the date from the RTC in ISO 8601 format - YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS   
**Returns:** date


```
enable_output() 
```
Enable the square-wave output on the SQW pin.  
**Returns:** null

```
disable_output()
```
Disable the square-wave output on the SQW pin.   
**Returns:** null

```
set_frequency(frequency)
```
Set the frequency for the square-wave output on the SQW pin.   
**Parameters:** frequency - options are: 1 = 1Hz, 2 = 4.096KHz, 3 = 8.192KHz, 4 = 32.768KHz   
**Returns:** null

```
write_memory(address, valuearray)
```
Write to the memory on the ds1307. The ds1307 contains 56-Byte, battery-backed RAM with Unlimited Writes  
**Parameters:** address - 0x08 to 0x3F  
valuearray - byte array containing data to be written to memory  
**Returns:** null

```
read_memory(address, length)
```
Read from the memory on the ds1307  
**Parameters:** address - 0x08 to 0x3F 
length - up to 32 bytes.  
length can not exceed the available address space.  
**Returns:** array of bytes

Usage
====

To use the RTC Pi library in your code you must first import the library:
```
from RTCPi import RTC
```

Next you must initialise the RTC object:

```
rtc = RTC()
```
Set the current time in ISO 8601 format:
```
rtc.set_date("2013-04-23T12:32:11")
```
Enable the square-wave output at 8.192KHz on the SQW pin:
```
rtc.set_frequency(3)
rtc.enable_output()
```
Read the current date and time from the RTC at 1 second intervals:
```
while (True):
  print rtc.read_date()
  time.sleep(1)
```
